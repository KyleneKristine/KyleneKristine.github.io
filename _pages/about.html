<h1>About</h1>
<p>Currently working at Brown University in the metadata unit, I use problem solving and programming skills to clean up and update the catalog. I recently graduated with a Masters in Library Science and have been working in the library field for over a decade now. </p>
 <p>My interests lay with exploring the effects of Discovery platforms and metadata on relevancy; and improving workflows and gathering data using basic programming languages.</p>

<p>My attitude toward all my work is:
<ul><li>What can I learn from this?</li>
  <li>How can I improve upon this?</li>
  <li>What could I do better next time?</li></ul></p>
